SharpZipLib (#ziplib, formerly NZipLib) is a compression library for Zip, GZip, BZip2, and Tar written entirely in C# for .NET. It is implemented as an assembly (installable in the GAC), and thus can easily be incorporated into other projects (in any .NET language). URL Project https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib
